## üß† Intelligent Image Recognition & Recommendation System

This project combines the power of **Google Cloud Vision API** and **FastAPI** to deliver a smart, scalable, and modern application that recognizes image content and recommends relevant items using **Content-Based** and **Collaborative Filtering** techniques.

### üîç Image Recognition with Google Cloud Vision API

Using the **Google Cloud Vision API**, the system can extract real-time, meaningful insights from any image ‚Äî including:

- **Objects & Labels** (e.g., "Dog", "Car", "Laptop")
- **Text from Images** (OCR)
- **Image Properties** (e.g., color detection, dominant hues)
- **Web Entities & Matching Images**

These insights make the application ideal for scenarios like product tagging, catalog enhancement, and smart metadata generation.

‚úÖ **Powered by**:  
- FastAPI (Backend Framework)  
- Google Cloud Vision (Image Analysis)  
- Python (Orchestration & Integration)

### üéØ Smart Recommendation System

To provide personalized and relevant results, this system also includes a dual-mode recommendation engine:

- **Content-Based Filtering**:  
  Recommends similar items by analyzing attributes extracted from the image, such as keywords, labels, and descriptions.

- **Collaborative Filtering**:  
  Learns from user interactions and preferences to suggest items others with similar tastes have liked.

üß© **Tech Stack Includes**:  
- Scikit-learn / TensorFlow (Recommendation Logic)  
- Pandas & NumPy (Data Processing)  
- Docker (Containerization & Deployment)

### üöÄ Use Cases

- E-commerce: Auto-tagging and product suggestions  
- Media: Contextual content recommendation  
- Lifestyle Apps: Personalized feed generation  
- Education: Visual learning aids based on image context
